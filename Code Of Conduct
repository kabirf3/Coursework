# Code of Conduct:

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behaviour.

### Expected Behaviour

All members of the group formally agree that these rules will be followed, the aim is for the group to give all their available efforts to this coursework that is 70% of our work. 

It’s important for the group to be:

- Respectful
- Punctual
- Understanding
- Confident
- Resilient
- Able to share their perspective
- Be inclusive
- Able to create a safe environment
- Participate equally

**Be Direct but Professional.** We should be honest about the work going on the team as it directly affects our performance. And while doing so, we need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful. No one should ever feel discouraged by the opinions of others. As a team, we will bring the best within us.

**Be respectful.** Disrespect will not be tolerated. Every perspective should be considered when making a group decision. If there are any disagreements within the group the majority opinion would be considered after a list of advantages and disadvantages of that decision has been thoroughly considered.v

## Labs and Meetings

It’s important to not miss labs, any meetings and code reviews as they all determine our success in this project, therefore every one of them must be attended unless there are mitigating circumstances. In this case, it is important to communicate those difficulties with the group. The meetings will take place on Mondays 1pm-2pm in the library. 

[**Attendance**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI4NIT4xxDGUpc1USZeu9gxUtHlVbLv0rDTFgDVAFb0/edit?usp=sharing)

**There are consequences for not following the set-out and agreed-upon rules:**

- **Missing one lab or meeting**: If one lab or meeting is missed then for the next time, the group member who has missed it will have to bring large hot drinks of the group members’ choice. They need to bring to each group member.
- **Missing two labs or meetings**: If two labs or meetings are missed in addition to the first set of consequences they would also have to take charge of the next available meeting and lead it to make sure that group members get most of the group meeting or lab the next.
- **Missing 3 or meetings**: If three or more meetings or labs are being missed then we require the group member who has been missing these labs/meetings to tell us the reasons why this is happening. The team would then try to resolve the issue within or take the lecturer’s aid in making sure the group members can attend labs or meetings moving forward. If the reasons are deemed trivial by the group, then the group member needs to be able to buy everyone a large hot drink of the group member's choice and buy each member a BBQ Pringles, and a 24-piece Ferrero Rocher.
- **If code review is missed**, further actions would be taken with the lecturer to ensure no other group members’ grades are being affected. We do believe that taking accountability for one’s actions is very important.

Rewards:

In summary the collective reward for all members of the group encompasses intangible benefits such as recognition through gestures like a pat on the shoulder, enhanced well-being manifested in increased happiness and reduced stress levels. Additionally, successful completion of the coursework may yield tangible rewards in the form of favorable grades.

It is imperative that each member actively engages and exerts their utmost effort throughout the duration of the project. This entails regular attendance in classes, active participation in group meetings, and thorough engagement in code reviews. Respectful conduct and openness to communication are fundamental expectations from all group members.

To facilitate effective collaboration and monitoring of individual contributions, Notion and Zube serve as the primary tools for tracking and documenting group progress and individual input.
